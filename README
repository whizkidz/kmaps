Kmaps is a logic game developed long ago by teachers
at Staten Island Technical High School. It is a 3D spin
on Tic-Tac-Toe, and much harder. Instead of Xs and Os,
the players are represented by 1s and 0s.

Each game has two four-by-four grids. The game is three-
dimensional, so when playing, imagine that the two grids
are actually on top of each other, with the corresponding
squares lining up. Furthermore, each grid has no real border:
the right-most square in a row is theoretically adjacent to
the left-most square in the same row, and the same goes for
top and bottom.

The goal of the game is to get as many quads as possible.
A quad is any two-by-two block or an entire row or column
of four squares with your player symbol in it. Keep in mind
that the game is three-dimensional, so two adjacent squares
on top of another two adjacent squares in the other grid is
also considered a quad. Finally, remember the grid has no
borders, so having two left-most adjacent squares and two
right-most adjacent squares in the same rows is a quad. As an
example, getting the four corners of any grid is a quad.

Then there is the octet. This is where you get two quads on
top of each other in the two different levels. An octet means
an automatic win, so be careful.

In this electronic version of the game, begin playing by
selecting either Player v. Computer or Player v. Player back
on the menu. For each turn, it asks you where you want to go.
Simply type a three digit number as your move, where the first
number is the grid (1 or 2), the second is the row (1, 2, 3, or 4)
and the third is the column (also 1, 2, 3, or 4). Don't worry,
the script will catch invalid moves.
